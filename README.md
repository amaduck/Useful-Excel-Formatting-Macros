# Useful-Excel-Macros

Some formatting macros that I get regular use out of, rather than rewriting when needed

Subs 
1) NextRow()
Selects the next row after the active row of the current sheet
2) HighlightAlternateRows()
For ease of display, will highlight every second row in the sheet, as far as the last used column
3) DeleteBlankRows()
Will check that a row is empty up to a certain number of columns, and delete if empty

Functions 
1) CountCharsinString(FindThis As String, StringToBeTested As String) As Integer
Returns the occurences of a particular character (or string of characters) in a particular string. Pass the string to find, and the string to be tested
2) AddSheetsAtEnd(NewSheetName)
Will add a new sheet with the passed sheet name
